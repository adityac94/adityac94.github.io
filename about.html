## Current Status

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad. I am also a part-time student at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad, where I am in the process of completing my Master's thesis. I am looking for PhD opportunities in Europe, Canada and USA. If all goes according to plan, I hope to be enrolled as a full-time PhD student by next Fall-2018.

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in topics related to machine learning and more specifically into developing mathematical methods to understand it. My current research involves trying to incorporate "interpretability" or "explainability" in black box deep learning algorithms. For my Master's thesis, I worked on probabilistic modelling of temporal relations in Monte Carlo simulations of molecular systems.
