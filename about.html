## Current Status

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad. My current research involves trying to incorporate "interpretability" or "explainability" in black box deep learning algorithms. I am also a part-time student at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad, where I am in the process of completing my Master's thesis.

## Autobiography

Unsure of what I want to do in life, in the year 2012, I decided to enroll myself in a dual-degree program at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad. The program offered me a B.Tech in Computer Science and a MS in Computational Natural Sciences, which seemed pretty lucrative at the time, given I had no idea what I wanted to achieve in life. The coursework was uniquely tailored to build strong fundamentals in computer science will also exposing us to ideas prevalent in core sciences like Quantum Chemistry, Thermodynamics, Nanotechnology to name a few. The first two years of my undergrad flew past, burying me in assignments, course projects, attending random conferences on various topics, participating in hackathons and coding competitions. Competitive coding (ACM-ICPC) and open-source development (Google Summer of Code) seemed to be "the" topics around here, with students burning the midnight candle to be the best of the best. I was in a quandary, neither of the above two seemed invigorating! 

Like all my batchmates, I went and spoke with various professors in the <i>Computational Natural Sciences</i> department, to figure out whose work I resonate with the most. It was here I met Prof. U Deva Priyakumar whose presentation on the HIV-1 Vpu transmembrane protein completely blew my mind. From my perspective, remove the layers of complexity, he along with some experimental chemists found a way to stop the propagation of HIV virus from one cell to another. I immediately set up a meeting with him, which would mark the beginning of a three-year long journey to the culmination of my Master's programme. 

Initially, I spent one semester working on a core topic from biology - protein unfolding. Protein folding/unfolding has been a subject of intensive research for decades now, and still we do not know how nature, regardless of the starting state of the unfolded protein, always achieves the same global minima (the folded or native state). This is no small feat as a single protein molecule as a huge number of degrees of freedom! Our lab came up with a novel mode of interaction which helps in shedding some more light on this outstanding phenomenon. This work was published recently in the <i>Journal of the American Chemical Society</i>.

It was in my sixth semester where I was first introcued to the building blocks of modern artificial intelligence- machine learning. Within the first 5 mins into the course "Statistical Methods in AI" I was amazed by the mere fact that something as simple as linear algebra can take you a long way in predicting whether a given fish sample is tuna or bass!
