## Current Status

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad. My current research involves trying to incorporate "interpretability" or "explainability" in black box deep learning algorithms. I am also a part-time student at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad, where I am in the process of completing my Master's thesis.

## Background Info

Unsure of what I want to do in life, in the year 2012, I decided to enroll myself in a dual-degree program at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad. The program offered me a B.Tech in Computer Science and a MS in Computational Natural Sciences, which seemed pretty lucrative at the time, given I had no idea what I wanted to achieve in life. The coursework was uniquely tailored to build strong fundamentals in computer science will also exposing us to ideas prevalent in core sciences like Quantum Chemistry, Thermodynamics, Nanotechnology to name a few.
