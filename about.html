## About Me

I am current working as a Research Assisstant at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad. My current research involves trying to incorporate "interpretability" or "explainability" in black box deep learning algorithms. I am also a part-time student at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad, where I am in the process of wrapping up my thesis. For my Master's thesis I worked on probabilistic modelling of Monte Carlo trajectories in molecular simulations.>.
