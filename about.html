## Current Status

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad. I am also a part-time student at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad, where I am in the process of completing my Master's thesis.  

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in topics related to machine learning and more specifically into optimization methods. My current research involves trying to incorporate "interpretability" or "explainability" in black box deep learning algorithms. For my Master's thesis I worked on probabilistic modelling of temporal relations in monte carlo simulations of molecular systems. Take a look at my <a href="https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~aditya.c/CV.pdf">CV</a> for more details about some of my selected projects.
